# VBA_Sorting_tool
VBA_Sorting_tool - Great tool to divide spreadsheet into separate sheets under condition.

This sorting tool can be used for any type of Excel, CSV spreadsheet that contains one or more conditions.
According to this condition, this tool sorts the whole spreadsheet and divides it into separate sheets.
After all the process, you can save each sheet and send it via Outlook from the mailing list group.

Keep in mind that this tool was created with three other (including me) great developers.
They also have strong rights to share this tool and sign their names to it.
